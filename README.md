- Part 1
I have chosen two stills from a film directed by Wong Kar-wai, *Chungking Express*. In these stills, the background, aside from the main characters, is blurred, almost like a long exposure effect. I believe this is an aesthetically pleasing way of expression, and at the same time, it highlights the clarity of the main subject. Applying this technique in my project allows me to balance aesthetics and the subject's clarity. Additionally, Wong Kar-wai is one of my favorite directors, so I can also use this project as a tribute to an artist I admire.
