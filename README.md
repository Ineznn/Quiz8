- Part 1

I have chosen two stills from a film directed by Wong Kar-wai, *Chungking Express*. In these stills, the background, aside from the main characters, is blurred, almost like a long exposure effect. I believe this is an aesthetically pleasing way of expression, and at the same time, it highlights the clarity of the main subject. Applying this technique in my project allows me to balance aesthetics and the subject's clarity. Additionally, Wong Kar-wai is one of my favorite directors, so I can also use this project as a tribute to an artist I admire.

- Part 2

Use the function **shininess** to adjust the glossiness of the desired part, and then use the function **noise** to adjust the noise. By combining the two, a blurred light effect can be achieved. Adjusting the glossiness along with the function **noise** creates a dreamy aesthetic, simulating the long exposure effect seen in movie stills. Using the **noise** function alone can also achieve a blurred and ethereal long-shot effect, but when combined with the glossiness of the **shininess** function, the result is even better, especially enhancing the halo effect.
